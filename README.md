# 15-Event-Schedule-Page
Description

An event schedule page displays the agenda or timeline of an event. This project helps you practice creating structured layouts using HTML tables or lists.
Features

    Event name and date
    List or table of sessions/talks/workshops
    Time, title, and speaker (if any) for each session

Explanation

This page uses:

    A <table> with headers and rows to clearly show session details
    <thead> and <tbody> for better table semantics
    Simple layout that can be styled into a full agenda or printed program

You can enhance this with CSS for better styling, or even JavaScript to filter sessions by track or category.
